# Machine Learning Lottery

## Purpose
Have fun. Maybe win something along the way. Maybe not.

### Set up
These scripts use Python. You will need an environment set up. Maybe one day I will make this easier to do. For now,
you need to install, via pip:
- `lz4`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `sklearn`

### How to run
Go to the directory you want to run and run `python <scriptname>.py`. That should be it. Nothing fancy.

### Notes
- Focus right now is on NJ Pick 6 and Cash 5 because they have straight numbers, nothing duplicated. 
- Testing various ways. 
- Good luck.

### Methodology
- Predict numbers using machine learning. 
- Validate that the sum of the predicted numbers is within x% of the mode of the most common sum of winning numbers.
- This would make more sense if I graphed it out. Maybe, again, one day.
